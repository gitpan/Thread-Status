README for Thread::Status

This module allows you to peek at the stack status of all running threads
without having to change anything within the code.  Depends on Thread::Signal
and therefore only works under Linux so far.

                         *** A note of CAUTION ***

This module only functions on Perl versions 5.8.0 and later.  And then
only when threads are enabled with -Dusethreads.  It is of no use with
any version of Perl before 5.8.0 or without threads enabled.
