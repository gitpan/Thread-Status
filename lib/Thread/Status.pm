=head1 DESCRIPTION

                  *** A note of CAUTION ***

 This module only functions on Perl versions 5.8.0 and later.
 And then only when threads are enabled with -Dusethreads.  It
 is of no use with any version of Perl before 5.8.0 or without
 threads enabled.

                  *************************

The Thread::Status module is mainly intended as a debugging aid for developers
of threaded programs.  It can generate a report of where processing is
occurring in all available threads, either automatically every X seconds, or
by the application of an external signal, or under program control.

The good thing is that you do B<not> need to change your program in any way.
By a smart use of signals, the code running in each thread is interrupted to
report its status.  And that is immediately the bad news: signals in threads
currently B<only work under Linux>.

To get a status report sent to STDERR every 5 seconds, simply add:

 -MThread::Status

to the command line.  So, if you would call your program with:

 perl yourprogram parameters

then

 perl -MThread::Status yourprogram parameters

will report the status of all the thread every 5 seconds on STDERR.

If you would like to have e.g. the output appear in a file with e.g. two levels
of caller information, you can specify the parameters on the command line as
well:

 perl -MThread::Status=output,filename,callers,2 yourprogram parameters

A typical output would be:

 0: line 19 in test1 (main)
 0: line 23 in test1 (main::run_the_threads in main)

 2: line 15 in test1 (main)
   0: line 17 in test1 (threads::new in main)
   0: line 23 in test1 (main::run_the_threads in main)

 3: line 11 in test1 (main)
   2: line 13 in test1 (threads::new in main)
     0: line 17 in test1 (threads::new in main)

=head1 CLASS METHODS

These are the class methods.

=head2 every

 Thread::Status->every( 5 );         # default, report every 5 seconds

 Thread::Status->every( 0 );         # do not create reports automatically

 $every = Thread::Status->every;

The "every" class method sets and returns the number of seconds that will pass
before the next report is automatically generated.  By default a report will
be created every B<5> seconds.  The value B<0> can be used to indicate that
no automatic reports should be generated.

=head2 callers

 Thread::Status->callers( 0 );       # default, return no caller lines
 
 Thread::Status->callers( 4 );       # return 4 callers

 $callers = Thread::Status->callers;

The "callers" class method sets and returns the number of callers that should
be shown in the report.  By default, no callers will be shown.

=head2 shorten

 Thread::Status->shorten( 1 );       # default, shorten
 
 Thread::Status->shorten( 0 );       # do not shorten package names

 $shorten = Thread::Status->shorten;

The "shorten" class method sets and returns whether package names should be
shortened in the report.  By default, package names will be shortened, to
create a more readable report.

=head2 format

 Thread::Status->format( 'plain' );  # default, make plain text report

 Thread::Status->format( 'xml' );    # make xml report

 $format = Thread::Status->format;

The "format" class method sets and returns the format in which the report
will be generated.  By default, the report will be created in plain text.
If you select 'xml', you may want to change the L<encoding> setting of the
XML that will be generated.

=head2 encoding

 Thread::Status->encoding( 'iso-latin-1' );  # default

 $encoding = Thread::Status->encoding;

The "encoding" class method sets and returns the encoding in which the report
will be generated if B<xml> was selected as the L<format>.  By default, the
report will be created in 'ISO-Latin-1' encoding.

=head2 output

 Thread::Status->output( 'filename' );  # write to specific file

 $output = Thread::Status->output;      # obtain current setting

The "output" class method returns the current output setting for the thread
report.  It can also be used to set the name of the file to which the report
will be written.  The strings "STDOUT" and "STDERR" can be used to indicate
standard output and standard error respectively.

=head2 signal

 Thread::Status->signal( 'HUP' );       # default

 $signal = Thread::Status->signal;      # obtain current setting

The "signal" class method sets and returns the signal that will be used
internally (and possibly externally if no automatic reports are generated).
By default the B<HUP> signal will be used.

Please note that the signal can B<only> be changed if monitoring has not yet
started.

=head2 start

 Thread::Status->start;

The "start" class method starts the thread that will perform the status
monitoring.  It can only be called once (or again after method L<stop> was
called).  Reports will be generated automatically depending on values
previously set with methods L<every>, L<callers>, L<shorten>, L<output>,
L<format> and L<encoding>.

=head2 report

 Thread::Status->report;

 $report = Thread::Status->report;

The "report" class method can be called in two ways:

=over 2

=item in void context

Generates a status report depending on values previously set with methods
L<every>, L<callers>, L<shorten>, L<output>, L<format> and L<encoding>.

=item in scalar context

Creates a data-structure of the status of all of the threads and returns a
reference to it.  The data-structure has the following format:

 - hash, keyed to thread id, filled with
 -  a reference to a list for each of the callers, in which element is
 -   a reference to a list with thread id and all of the fields of caller()

so that:

 foreach my $tid (sort {$a <=> $b} keys %{$report}) {
   print "Thread $tid:\n";
   my $level = 0;
   foreach my $level (@{$report->{$tid}}) {
     print "  Level $level: $level->[2], line $level->[3]\n";
   }
 }

will give you an overview of the status.

=head2 stop

The "stop" class method stops the thread that performs the status monitoring.
It can only be called after method L<start> has been called.

=head2 monitor_tid

 $tid = Thread::Status->monitor_tid;

The "monitor_tid" class method returns the thread id of the thread that
performs the status monitoring.

=head2 monitor_pid

 $pid = Thread::Status->monitor_pid;

The "monitor_pid" class method returns the process id of the thread that
performs the status monitoring.

=head1 OPTIMIZATIONS

This module uses L<AutoLoader> to reduce memory and CPU usage. This causes
subroutines only to be compiled in a thread when they are actually needed at
the expense of more CPU when they need to be compiled.  Simple benchmarks
however revealed that the overhead of the compiling single routines is not
much more (and sometimes a lot less) than the overhead of cloning a Perl
interpreter with a lot of subroutines pre-loaded.

=head1 CAVEATS

This module relies on the L<Thread::Signal> module.  There are currently a
number of limitations when using the Thread::Signal module.  Check the CAVEATS
section of that module for up-to-date information.
