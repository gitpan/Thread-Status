0.03    30 September 2002
	Use "load.pm" instead of AutoLoader.  Increased dependency on
	Thread::Signal to 1.06 in Makefile.PL.

	Removed "our" from $VERSION, should shave off some bytes in
        memory usage, as found from testing with Benchmark::Thread::Size.

0.02	17 September 2002
	Changed name of "each" to "every", which seems to be gramatically more
	appropriate compared to its function.

	Added a lot of documentation that was still missing.

	Removed the threads::shared::cond_wait() hijacking code: no longer
	necessary because new signal setting code in Thread::Signal.

	Increased dependency on Thread::Signal to 1.05, to make use of the
	new signal setting code that should also work in cond_wait().

0.01	9 September 2002
	First version of Thread::Status.  Really alpha state, really.
